### Asset attributes

Tenant administrators and customer users are able to manage asset server-side [attributes](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/attributes/).

### Asset alarms

Tenant administrators and customer users are able to browse asset [alarms](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/alarms/).
To configure an alarm, you should create relations from asset to the device, add an alarm rule and trigger the alarm via terminal.
After these actions, you can see the triggered alarm in the asset details.

Tenant administrators and customer users can browse events related to a particular asset using the Events tab. Events help to track each message to see what happened to an asset.  
Error event displays major problems that could affect asset's work.  
Lifecycle event displays when the asset was created and if it was successful.  
Statistics event displays how many messages were proceeded and how many errors were there.
Raw data event is using while debugging.

_Documentation dedicated to events is coming soon._
