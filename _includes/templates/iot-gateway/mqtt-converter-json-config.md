Json converter is default converter, it looks for deviceName, deviceType, attributes and telemetry in the incoming message from the broker, with rules, described in this subsection:

|**Parameter**|**Default value**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|-
| type                        | **json**                  | Provides information to connector that default converter to be used for converting data from topic.                                       |
| deviceNameJsonExpression    | **${serialNumber}**       | Simple JSON expression, uses for looking device name in the incoming message (parameter "serialNumber" will be used as device name).      |
| deviceTypeJsonExpression    | **${sensorType}**         | Simple JSON expression, uses for looking device type in the incoming message (parameter "sensorType" will be used as device type).        |
| timeout                     | **60000**                 | Timeout for triggering "Device Disconnected" event                                                                                        |

**Note**: The device profile is set when the device is created. Changing the device profile using a Gateway is not provided.


Mapping subsection for Example 1 will look like:

```json
    {
      "topicFilter": "/sensor/data",
      "converter": {
        "type": "json",
        "deviceNameJsonExpression": "${serialNumber}",
        "deviceTypeJsonExpression": "${sensorType}",
        "timeout": 60000,
        "attributes": [
          {
            "type": "string",
            "key": "model",
            "value": "${sensorModel}"
          }
          {
            "type": "string",
            "key": "${sensorModel}",

          }
        ],
        "timeseries": [

            "type": "double",
            "key": "temperature",
            "value": "${temp}"
          },

            "value": "${hum}"
          }
        ]

Mapping for Example 2 will look like:
