  - Advanced and flexible IoT data visualization for both real-time and historical vehicle data;
  - Customizable end-user dashboards to share data from the vehicle tracking system with end users and customers;
  - Remote control and OTA updates for your smart trackers;
  - Customizable mobile applications with minimum coding efforts;

## Fleet tracking dashboard

The following interactive dashboard hosted on live demo server represents vehicle routes and state indicators that may be embedded in your IoT fleet tracking project. See dashboard description below.

    <a target="_blank" href="https://demo.thingsboard.io/dashboard/3d0bf910-ee09-11e6-b619-bb0136cc33d0?publicId=963ab470-34c9-11e7-a7ce-bb0136cc33d0" class="button">View live demo</a>
</div>

The live dashboard displays real-time bus location, speed and fuel level collected using ThingsBoard MQTT API.
Collected data is processed via the rule engine to raise alarms on when:

 * Vehicle leaves configurable route perimeter;
 * Vehicle is not moving for 2 minutes while on route;
 * Fuel level is low;
 * Violation of speed limits;

The main dashboard displays the bus location, corresponding alarms, and the latest values of bus speed, fuel and status.
Click on the alarm or bus row to open the vehicle details and route history.

Of course, you may extend the list of alarms and completely customize the dashboard. 
You may export the dashboard from our live demo server and import it to your ThingsBoard instance.
You may edit the route area widget and enable configuration of the route area for your local copy of the dashboard.

## Fleet tracking solution overview

The diagram below identifies data flow and integration points for a typical fleet-tracking solution that uses the ThingsBoard platform to collect and analyze data from vehicle trackers.

<object width="100%" style="max-width: max-content; margin: 32px 0" data="/images/iot-use-cases/fleet-tracking.svg"></object>

You may notice plenty of connectivity options for the vehicle trackers: direct connection to the cloud, through the IoT Gateway or integration with a third-party system.
Most of vehicle-tracking projects today use direct connection to the cloud using MQTT or CoAP in case of NB IoT. 
ThingsBoard supports either plain JSON or Protobuf, which significantly optimize network traffic and increase battery life;

The platform supports industry-standard encryption algorithms and device credentials types. ThingsBoard stores data in the fault-tolerant and reliable Cassandra database.
The Rule Engine enables forwarding incoming data to various analytics systems, such as Apache Spark or Hadoop, using Kafka or other Message buses.
